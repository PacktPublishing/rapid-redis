## About the Video Course
The days of having to rely only on a SQL database are gone. Now, you have a multitude of options for your data and you need to pick the right store for the right job. You may just need a simple, easy-to-use key-value store, or perhaps a blazing fast in-memory database; in comes Redis to your rescue! There is a whole world of excited developers discussing how Redis is making their lives simpler with its lightning-fast operations on in-memory datasets.

This course teaches you the key aspects of this flexible data store. You’ll learn how a NoSQL data store such as Redis differs from traditional SQL databases that you may be more familiar with. You’ll see how to install the database on your own machine, or use a database provider in the cloud. You’ll also discover the basic native data types of Redis and how to use them.

From theory to application, Rapid Redis explains when, why, and how to use the Redis data store. We’ll discuss the differences between NoSQL and SQL, explore the Redis data types to see how to use them, and end up with an easy-to-understand Node.js example app that uses Redis as a cache.

No matter what kind of application you’re working on, you need a place to store your data. Rapid Redis gives you a new tool to add to your toolbox: a data store that is quick and easy to use, and far more powerful than you can imagine.
